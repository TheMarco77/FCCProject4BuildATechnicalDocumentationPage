                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language.
                <br>Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its
                <br> environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
                
                <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language
                <br>elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety
                <br> of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its
                        <br>Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
                        <br> elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server.
                        <br>For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity 
                        <br>of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
                    </li> 
                </ul>
                <p>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
                <br> For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as
                <br>mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</p>

                    <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. 
                        <br>The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript 
                        <br>follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was 
                        <br>renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
                        <br><br>
                        In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a
                        <br>small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model 
                        <br>instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what 
                        <br>is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements.
                        <br>Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
                        <br><br>
                        JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. 
                        <br>You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to 
                        <br>implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.
                    </p>
                    <p><h1>Hello world</h1>
                        To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
                    </p>

                    <code>
                            function greetMe(yourName) {
                                <br>alert("Hello " + yourName);
                                <br>}
                                <br>greetMe("World");
                    </code>

                    <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>


                    <code></code>

                    <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other
                    <br> code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available
                    <br> only within that function.</p><br>

                    <br>
                    <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local
                    <br> to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the 
                    <br>scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.</p>

                        <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                        <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                        <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                        <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
